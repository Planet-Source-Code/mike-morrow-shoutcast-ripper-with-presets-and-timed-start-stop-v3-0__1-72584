Error in: " & err.Source

This is an error in the control rounding code.  Your guess is as good (maybe better) than mine on this one!  It
can contain any error message because it is in a common error handler routine servicing many different subroutines
and situations.

TOP1
Directory Error TOP1 Cannot find the folder " & txtOutPath & ".  Please change the path or create it.

This error occurs when you tell the program to use a directory (folder) which does not exist.  This needs to be
fixed.  If you are reading this, guess what?  It has not been!
